VPC: 10.0.0.0/16

Subnets (all /24):

Public A: 10.0.1.0/24 — associated with Internet Gateway (IGW)

Public B: 10.0.2.0/24 — associated with IGW

Private A: 10.0.3.0/24 — no direct IGW access

Private B: 10.0.4.0/24 — no direct IGW access

Networking components:

Internet Gateway attached to VPC for public subnets

NAT Gateway deployed in Public Subnet 1 for private-subnet egress


Explainations:
I set up a network that gives public servers direct internet access and keeps backend servers isolated. The overall network is large enough for 
many subnets, and I created two public segments for internet-facing machines and two private segments for internal machines. Private machines 
reach the internet only through a gateway placed in one of the public segments, so their outbound access can be controlled while they remain 
inaccessible from the internet.

Routing:

Public route table: 0.0.0.0/0 → IGW

Private route table: 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway

Outcome: public-facing workloads run in public subnets; backend services run in private subnets with controlled outbound internet access via the NAT.
