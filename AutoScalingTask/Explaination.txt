Here is the Explaination:
I designed a highly available setup by placing an Internet-facing Application Load Balancer across two public subnets. The EC2 configuration was migrated into a Launch Template and deployed in private subnets using an Auto Scaling Group (ASG). Incoming traffic from the internet hits the ALB, which forwards requests to healthy EC2 instances in the target group. The ASG manages scaling across multiple Availability Zones to maintain availability and resilience. Instances located in the private subnets use a NAT Gateway to reach the internet for updates. Overall, this architecture provides fault tolerance, automatic scaling, and secure workloads isolated from direct public access.
