Explaination:
a)Why cost monitoring is important for beginners?

Cost monitoring is essential because beginners can easily leave resources running unintentionally (like EC2, NAT Gateways, ALBs, or RDS).
Without alerts, charges accumulate silently, and AWS may bill you more than expected.
Billing alarms help track usage, avoid overspending, and keep everything within Free Tier limits.

b) What causes sudden increases in AWS bills?

Common reasons for sudden AWS bill spikes include:
Running EC2 instances 24/7
Keeping NAT Gateway active (₹700–₹800/month)
ALB charges when active
High S3 PUT/GET traffic
Using paid services (RDS, Elastic IP without EC2, DynamoDB reads/writes, Lambda GB-seconds)
Transferring data across AZs
Leaving CloudWatch logs and volumes uncleaned


Billing alarms and Free Tier alerts protect against unexpected extra costs.
